            This Privacy Policy describes how Scrubbe (legal entity: Scrubbe
            Limited, registered at 456 Innovation Avenue, Lagos, Nigeria)
            collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal data in connection

            If you are a customer (an organization using Scrubbe IMS), the
            relationship between you and Scrubbe regarding personal data is
            primarily governed by the Master Service Agreement and Data
            Processing Agreement (DPA) we execute with you. In many cases,
            customer determines the purposes and means for processing the
            content they upload; in those cases, the customer is the &quot;data
            controller&quot; and Scrubbe is the &quot;data processor.&quot;
            Where Scrubbe collects personal data directly (e.g., user account
            sign-up), Scrubbe acts as the controller.
